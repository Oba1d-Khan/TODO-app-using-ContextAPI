This TODO project is made using React & Tailwind,
It uses Context API for state managemnt,

Main Purpose of this app is to grasp solid concepts of Context API along with local storage.

Notes to Remember :

1. Whenever we wanna add some new item in an object without overriding the previous ones, we should use callback function in the setter method! with a param as "prevItem" etc as the param holds/given an array of older items.

2. One Con of Local Storage is that: It converts the values to strings.SO we have to convert into JSON.
